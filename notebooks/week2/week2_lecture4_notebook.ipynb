    "#### Week 2 - FTP Bulk Download & APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we're going to practice using bulk download and API in a practical example. This week we are going to be looking at a resource called GenCC - The Gene Curation Collection - https://thegencc.org\n",
    "\n",
    "GenCC is primarily focussed on providing a unified source of gene-disease relationships that is harmonised across the various international efforts that operate in this space. In the process of doing so they are establishing standards for curation and annotation to maximise the consitency and useability of their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our efforts today will focus on a full FTP download of the GenCC data, some parsing, and use of the API at Bioportal to gather more information about some of the elements of the GenCC data. This is a **slightly** contrived example, but hopefully it is both interesting and useful to give you an idea of how these two approaches can be used together."
